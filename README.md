MY JOURNEY AFTER COMING TO IIT IS VERY AMAZING AND LEARNING.I DID ALMOST EVERYTHING AFTER COMING HERE EXCEPT STUDYING BUT MANAGED TO GET GOOD GRADES. TO BE HONEST I DON'T WANT TO STUDY AT ALL . I JUST WANT TO LEARN NEW THINNGS AND SKILLS. I ALWAYS WONDER HOW ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS AND HOW CAN WE HACK EVERYTHING . IF I AM INTO SOMETHING THEN I DON'T EVER LEAVE IT UNTILL I FINISH IT AND NOW I AM INTO CODING!!.
